# What I Hope to Learn

I am really interested in some more advanced forms of analysis in GIS. I am hoping to expand my capabailities within spatial data science. I recently learned more about ArcGIS insights, which I am also very excited to learn more about. Overall, I find GIS to be quite enjoyable and am looking forward to all of the content covered in the course.
