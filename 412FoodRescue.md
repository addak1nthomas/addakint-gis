# Assignment 1: Build and deploy a custom Google Map for a non-profit organization
## Map
Check out the map that I created to support the efforts of a Pittsburgh-based non-profit organization, 412 Food Rescue, by clicking [HERE](https://addak1nthomas.github.io/addakint-gis/412FRMap.html)

## About [412 Food Rescue](https://412foodrescue.org/get-started/)
### What do they do?
412 Food Rescue works to prevent perfectly good food from entering the waste stream by redirecting it to those who are experiencing food insecurity.

### Why do they do it? 
412 Food Rescue was founded as a direct response to the disconnect between food waste, hunger, and environmental sustainability. **We waste up to 40% of our food** globally (translating to over 1.3 billion tons annually), while **1 in 7 people go hungry every day**. According to ReFed, if we recovered about half (46 billion pounds) of the food being wasted, we could feed every hungry person in the United States 3 meals a day, every day.

### Core Values & Beliefs
**1.** Good food belongs to people, not landfills
**2.** Everyone has a right to healthy food
**3.** Climate change requires urgent action

### How do they do it?
They partner with food retailers, volunteer drivers, and nonprofit organizations to connect surplus food with individuals and families who are experiencing food insecurity. Their intuitive app guides thousands of **volunteers who we call Food Rescue Heroes**, to rescue perfectly good but unsellable food that would otherwise be wasted and redirect it to people who need it

## Map Information
### Map Design
I utilized [Canva's Color Palette Generator](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/) to help build a color palette that is relative to the scheme that 412 Food Rescue uses on their public website. (IMAGE of COLOR PALETTE)

### Map Code
A copy of the JSON file used to generate the customized map can be found (HERE).
